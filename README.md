# Progress-bars  test assignment     

Hey, I just want to say that while this is completely my fault, I somewhat shoot myself in the foot by trying to implement extra functionality to the assignment.   
While I did successfully finish the test and implement the 'extra' that I wanted, I am not exactly happy with the quality of the code since I was running low on time and was more concerned with making it all work.  
  
So that's that.
